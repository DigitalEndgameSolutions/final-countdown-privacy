<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="date">Effective Date: February 28, 2026</p>

<p><strong>Final Countdown</strong> ("the App") is developed by Rupert Russell. This policy describes how the App handles your information.</p>

<h2>Data Collection</h2>
<p>The App does <strong>not collect, store, or transmit any personal data</strong> to external servers. All data you create in the App (event names, dates, notes, and photos) is stored exclusively on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework.</p>

<h2>Photos</h2>
<p>If you choose to add a custom photo icon to an event, the image is selected via Apple's PhotosUI framework and stored locally on your device. The App does not access your full photo library — only the specific image you select is used, and it never leaves your device.</p>

<h2>Analytics &amp; Tracking</h2>
<p>The App does not use any analytics, advertising, or tracking frameworks. No data is shared with third parties.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The App does not integrate with any third-party services, APIs, or SDKs that collect user data.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>The App does not knowingly collect information from children. Since no data is collected from any user, it is safe for all ages.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>If this policy is updated, the revised version will be posted at this URL with an updated effective date.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
